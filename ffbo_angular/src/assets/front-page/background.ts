    Animal behavior is governed by the activity of interconnected brain circuits.
    Comprehensive brain wiring maps are thus needed in order to formulate hypotheses
    about information flow and also to guide genetic manipulations aimed at understanding
    how genes and circuits orchestrate complex behaviors. A successful determination
    of how the brain's highly complex structure implements specific functions requires
    its decomposition into functional modules whose input-output relationships can be
    individually analyzed and whose interactions can be explained in terms of the groups
    of synaptic connections that exist between them.

    The fruit fly brain is one of the most popular model organisms for studying neural
    computation and for relating brain structure to function. Amazingly, many of the genes
    and proteins expressed in the mammalian brain are also conserved in the genome of
    Drosophila. The fruit fly is capable of a host of complex nonreactive behaviors that
    are governed by a brain containing only ~150,000 neurons. The relationship between the
    fly's brain and its behaviors continue to be experimentally probed using a powerful
    toolkit of genetic techniques for manipulation of the fly'ss neural circuitry. In addition,
    novel experimental methods for precise recordings of the fly's neuronal responses to stimuli
    and for mapping neurons and synapses in Drosophila nervous system provide access to an
    immense amount of valuable data regarding the fly's neural connectivity map and processing
    of sensory stimuli. These features, coupled with the growing ethical and economic pressures
    to reduce the use of mammals in research, explain the growing interest in Drosophila-based
    brain models, not only for understanding sensing, perception and neural computation but also
    for elucidating the mechanisms of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Epilepsy and
    Parkinson's disease
