        <br>March 16-17, 2020
        <br>Davis Auditorium, CEPSR
        <br>Columbia University, New York, NY, USA</h4><br>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in developing executable models of
neural computation/processing of the brain of model organisms.
Of interest are models of computation that consist of elementary units
of processing using brain circuits and memory elements. Elementary units of computation/processing
include population encoding/decoding circuits with biophysically-grounded neuron models, non-linear dendritic processors for motion detection/direction selectivity, spike processing and pattern recognition neural circuits,
movement control and decision-making circuits, etc.
Memory units include models of spatio-temporal memory circuits, circuit models for memory access and
storage, etc.
A major aim of the workshop is to explore the integration of various sensory and control circuits in higher brain centers.

        <p><strong>A Similarity-preserving Neural Network Trained on Transformed Images Recapitulates Salient Features of the Fly Motion Detection Circuit</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/dmitri-mitya-chklovskii/">Dmitri ‘Mitya’ Chklovskii</a>, Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation.</p>

        <p>Learning to detect content-independent transformations from data is one of the central problems in biological and artificial intelligence. An example of such problem is unsupervised learning of a visual motion detector from pairs of consecutive video frames. Rao and Ruderman formulated this problem in terms of learning infinitesimal transformation operators (Lie group generators) via minimizing image reconstruction error. Unfortunately, it is difficult to map their model onto a biologically plausible neural network (NN) with local learning rules. Here we propose a biologically plausible model of motion detection. We also adopt the transformation-operator approach but, instead of reconstruction-error minimization, start with a similarity-preserving objective function. An online algorithm that optimizes such an objective function naturally maps onto an NN with biologically plausible learning rules. The trained NN recapitulates major features of the well-studied motion detector in the fly. In particular, it is consistent with the experimental observation that local motion detectors combine information from at least three adjacent pixels, something that contradicts the celebrated Hassenstein-Reichardt model.</p>

        <p><strong>Molecular and Systems Neuroscience of Active Forgetting</strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.scripps.edu/davis">Ronald L. Davis</a>, Scripps Research Florida, Jupiter, FL.</p>

        <p>Experimental psychologists have studied active forgetting for decades, but the molecular, cellular and system mechanisms for forgetting have remained a mystery. I will summarize our studies across the last 8 years on active forgetting of olfactory memory in Drosophila. Our results indicate that a small number of dopamine neurons in the fly brain function as “forgetting cells,” for short- and intermediate-term memories, promoting the erosion of behavioral memory and the cellular memory traces that form at learning in the neurons of the mushroom body circuit. The forgetting cells exhibit slow, chronic activity, although this activity is increased by sensory stimulation to the fly and decreased by sleep, providing a mechanistic explanation for retroactive interference and retroactive facilitation, respectively. The mushroom body cells in this circuit receive the dopaminergic-forgetting signal through a specific dopamine receptor that mobilizes an intracellular biochemical signaling cascade terminating in the activation of the small molecules Rac1 and Cofilin, molecules known to re-model the actin cytoskeleton. We speculate that such re-modeling removes changes in actin cytoskeleton structure instilled at learning. More recent results have shown that a different circuit and set of dopaminergic neurons mediate the transient forgetting of long-term olfactory memories. An overriding conclusion from our studies is that the brain is designed with active mechanisms to forget memories along with mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation.</p>

        <p><strong>Cell Type Classification and Multi-modal Correspondence in Mouse Visual Cortex</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/nathan-gouwens/">Nathan Gouwens</a>, Allen Institute of Brain Science, Seattle, WA.</p>

        <p>Addressing the complexity of neuronal circuits by classifying cellular components into meaningful types is an ongoing challenge. Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have provided high-dimensional, high-throughput classifications of neocortical neurons. However, it is unclear to what extent these types are consistent in other domains, such as in their intrinsic electrophysiological and morphological properties. To investigate this, we have systematically recorded from mouse visual cortical interneurons labeled by transgenic lines, followed by morphological reconstruction and transcriptomic analysis when possible. Our analyses inform cell type classification by characterizing patterns of cell-by-cell co-variation in gene expression, local morphology, and electrophysiological properties. We have also used these data to build biophysical models that can populate circuit models reflecting our current understanding of cortical cell types.</p>

        <p><strong>How States and Needs Shape Odor Perception and Behavior</strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.neuro.wzw.tum.de">Ilona Grunwald Kadow</a>, School of Life Sciences, Technical University of Munich.</p>

        <p>Neuromodulation permits flexibility of synapses, neural circuits and ultimately behavior. One neuromodulator, dopamine, has been studied extensively in its role as reward signal during learning and memory across animal species. Newer evidence suggests that dopaminergic neurons (DANs) can modulate sensory perception acutely, thereby allowing an animal to adapt its behavior and decision-making to its internal and behavioral state. In addition, some data indicate that DANs are heterogeneous and convey different types of information as a population. We have investigated DAN population activity and how it could encode relevant information about sensory stimuli and state by taking advantage of the confined anatomy of DANs innervating the mushroom body (MB) of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using in vivo calcium imaging and a custom 3D image registration method, we find that the activity of the population of MB DANs is predictive of the innate valence of an odor as well as the metabolic and behavioral state of the animal, suggesting that distinct DAN population activities encode innate odor valence, movement and physiological state in a MB compartment specific manner. This information could influence perception and state-dependent decision making as suggested by behavioral analysis. We propose that dopamine shapes innate odor perception through combinatorial population coding of sensory valence, physiological and behavioral context.</p>

        <p><strong>Binocular Photoreceptor Microsaccades Give Fruit Fly Hyperacute 3D-Vision</strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://cognition.group.shef.ac.uk">Mikko Juusola</a>, Centre for Cognition in Small Brains, The University of Sheffield.</p>

        <p>Neural mechanisms behind stereovision, which requires simultaneous disparity inputs from two eyes, have remained mysterious. Here we show how ultrafast synchronous mirror-symmetric photomechanical contractions in the frontal forward-facing left and right eye photoreceptors give Drosophila super-resolution 3D-vision. By combining in vivo 100-nm-resolution x-ray imaging with electrophysiology and fly genetics, in vivo high-speed optical imaging, mathematical modelling and behavioural paradigms, we reveal how these photoreceptor microsaccades - by verging and narrowing the eyes’ overlapping receptive fields - channel depth information, as phasic binocular image motion disparity signals in time, to hyperacute stereovision and learning. We further show how peripherally, outside the stereoscopic sampling, photoreceptor microsaccades match a forward flying fly’s optic flow field to better resolve the world in motion. These results change our understanding of how insect compound eyes work, highlight the importance of fast photoreceptor vergence for enhancing 3D perception, and suggest coding strategies to improve man-made sensors.</p>

        <p><strong>What Does a Cognitive Goal Look Like in the Brain?</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://maimonlab.rockefeller.edu">Gaby Maimon</a>, Laboratory of Integrative Brain Function, The Rockefeller University.</p>

        <p>I will discuss a neural circuit that begins to explain how flies compare the angle in which they are currently oriented in the world with the angle in which they wish to be oriented - a goal heading angle that they can flexibly change - to determine which way to turn, how hard to turn, and how fast to walk forward. This detailed circuit in a small brain should inspire one to think more clearly about how larger mammalian brains, like our own, set goals and then compel behaviors to achieve those goals.</p>

        <p><strong>Microinsects: Extreme Miniaturization or Perfect Optimization?</strong></p>
        <p>Alexey A. Polilov, Department of Entomology, Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University.</p>

        <p>Miniaturization is one of the principal directions of insect evolution. As a result of miniaturization, many insects have become smaller than some unicellular organisms. Such insects have repeatedly evolved in many orders; on the one hand, they are fascinating as model organisms for studying scaling; on the other hand, they are great examples of the perfect optimization of the structure of many systems, especially the nervous system and sensory organs.</p>

        <p>In my talk I will discuss the smallest insect. My attention will be focused on the structure and ultrastructure of the nervous system and sensory organs, the radical transformations implemented in them by miniaturization in some microinsects, and how these systems retain their basic functions, despite their extremely small sizes. The early results of the study of the microinsect connectome will also be presented. The minute size and extreme simplicity and functionality of these insects suggest that they could be used as ideal model organisms for connectomics and other areas of neuroscience.</p>

        <p><strong>Universality of Information Encoding in Brain Regions Using a Specific Combinatorial Code</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/charles-f-stevens/">Charles F. Stevens</a>, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA.</p>

        <p>Information in the brain is believed to be usually encoded by which neurons are activated by a stimulus. For example, in the primary visual cortex, the slopes of lines or edges at a particular location in the visual scene are encoded by which orientation selective neurons are active in response to the line or edge. In other brain areas, however, many of the same neurons are activated by every stimulus, so information is encoded not by which neurons are active but by a pattern of activity in a population of neurons that respond to most stimuli. Such brain regions use a combinatorial code to distinguish between alternative stimuli.</p>

        <p>An example of such a brain region is the population of projection neurons in the fruit fly antennal lobe. About a dozen copies of each of about 50 genetically distinct types of odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) are present in the fly’s nose, and all of the neurons of the same type project to one of about fifty glomeruli in the antennal lobe. The output of each antennal lobe glomerulus is one of about 50 types of projection neurons that send olfactory information about odor type to Kenyon Cells in the mushroom body. Most of the 50 types of antennal lobe projection neurons fire in response to most odors.</p>

        <p>The distribution of firing rates across the antennal lobe responsive projection neurons is the same for almost all odors: it is an exponential distribution with a mean that is the same across all odor types. What differs from one odor to the next is not the distribution of firing rates, but rather is which neurons have which rates in the distribution, so that odor type is encoded by the pattern of firing rates across projection neurons.</p>

        <p>This same combinatorial code is known to be used across two additional brain areas. One is the mouse olfactory system and the other is the monkey code used for human faces in the inferotemporal cortex. I will discuss these additional regions and describe the universality of the code they use.</p>
